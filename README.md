#### Some codes about Natural Language Processing

### Usage

```
$ python baseline.py
```

### Output

The segmentation of a sentence in Chinese.

### Notice

The file that I worked on is segmenter/baseline.py .
Actually it does not work.
The sample code from default.py is not the latest one, and the algorithm comments are out of date.
